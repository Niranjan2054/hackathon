1.All submissions for this problem are available.Arjun and Sara are best friends and they love pizza (who doesn't). One day they had bet on who can eat more slices of pizza than the other.

Arjun and Sara took turns eating p1 and p2 slices respectively. This kept going until they ran out of money. Each pizza has exactly 6 slices and the turn always starts with Arjun and ends with Sara having the last slice.

Find out who ate more slices of pizza.

Input:
-The first line of input contains two integers m and c.
-m is the total amount of money they have and c is the cost of pizza.
-Second line of input contains multiple integers, i.e. the number of slices (based on the cost of pizza and the total amount) which Arjun and Sara ate in each turn.

Output:
Name of the person who ate more number of slices.

Constraint:
1≤m≤104
1≤c≤1000
1≤p1≤10
1≤p2≤10

2.All submissions for this problem are available.In AlphaMatrix Cipher, there is a 5x5 matrix containing all the letters of the English alphabet sequentially except one letter called as The Rogue Letter (since there are 26 letters and the matrix can only contain 25 elements).

Each letter is substituted with an integer value which is the concatenated value of the row and column position of that letter (row and column positions are taken from 1 to 5).

Given a Rogue Letter and the ciphered integer values, decipher the given string (assuming the string has only lowercase letters - ASCII value is from 97 to 122).

Input:
The First line contains an integer n, specifying the number of test cases. n test cases follow.
Each line of the test case contains three data: a character r (Rogue Letter) followed by another integer l which specifies the number of characters in the string and then multiple 2 digit integers (each cipher integer represent one character of the string).
Output:
For each test case, output is a single string which is the deciphered text.

3. All submissions for this problem are available.It's Samar's birthday. Samar loves Mathematics. He likes to cut his cake in such a way that size of all the pieces of the cake cut by him is a power of 2.

Given the size of cake, find out the minimum number of pieces of cake Samar can cut.

Input:
The First line will contain an integer n, specifying the number of test cases. n test cases follow.
Each line of the test case contains an integer p which specifies the size of the cake.
Output:
For each test case, output is the minimum number of pieces Samar can get by cutting the cake into pieces, size of which is a power of 2.
